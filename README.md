# face_detection_using_knn
This project implements a face detection and recognition system using Python, leveraging the power of machine learning and computer vision techniques. The system combines the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, Haar Cascade classifiers, and OpenCV for an efficient and accurate solution.
